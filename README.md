## üìã Requirements and ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

- exercise 1:

Since this exercise submits data via a form, you need to run it through a local server like XAMPP. Start your server and open your browser at the URL pointing to the folder containing the index.php file. For example:

`http://localhost/your-local-folderproject-folder/exercise-folder/`

Make sure to replace your-local-folder, project-folder, and exercise-folder with the actual names of your folders to see and use the form.

- exercise 2 and 3:

You can view the results in your terminal. Make sure the PHP executable is included in your environment variables and that you are in the folder where the file is located.

Run the following command in your terminal to execute the script:

- `php filename.php`

Make sure to replace `filename.php` with the actual name of the PHP file you want to run.
